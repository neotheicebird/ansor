<h3>What is Big-O notation?</h3>

<strong>Big-O notation is a relative representation of the complexity of an algorithm</strong><br>
<code><pre>The complexity of various examples are given below:<br>
O(1) means in constant time - independent of the number of items.<br>
O(N) means in proportion to the number of items.<br>
O(log N) means a time proportional to log(N)<br>
O(N!) means a time proportional to N!<br>
O(N**a) means a time proportional to N**a, where a could be 2, 3 even 1.5</pre></code>
<p>
Lets take two numbers 3 and 5. We can do addition, multiplication, division, subtraction and so on with it, 
for each of the operations we would have to come up with an algorithm to solve it. If addition is the costliest
operation in the algorithm, the bottleneck part then to add two numbers of 2 digits each we need to do about 3 additions,
then for a 6-digit number about 11 additions, a close guess of the number of additions would be, for two n-digit numbers,
it is 2*n-1. so we can say that this follows O(n) complexity, linearly increasing.
</p>
<p>
For multiplication it is a little different, If we have two 100-digit numbers we need to do 10,000 multiplications
and 200 adds. For two one million digit numbers we need to do one trillion (10**12) multiplications 
and two million adds. i.e. for two numbers of n-digits, the total number of operations taken is n**2 + 2n, 
of which the 2n part accounts for less than 0.0002%, totally insignificant.
</p>

<p>
So the complexity of the algrithm is O(n**2) or quadratic complexity. 
<strong>We only care about the most significant portion of complexity.</strong>

Now for some cool stuff. Take a list of 1-million names, you know the number of items in the list, 
and you have to find John Smith. Assume the list is sorted alphabatically 
(sorting is a one time operation in a database, so even it is not very expensive, 
compared to sorting each time a name is queried)
</p>

Now how make hits do we have to take before we find "John Smith"?
<p>
If we go one by one, it takes a maximum of N hits before we could find John (John could be the last name). 
A better approach is split the list by half, see the first name of the second half of list, 
now you know if John falls in the first half or the second. This is called <strong>Binary search</strong>.
</p>

<p>
For 1-million names, it takes only 20 iterations to hit "John" (Bang!) Now that is serious power! 
and this complexity of algorithms is called <strong>O(log n)</strong> or logarithmic complexity.
</p>

Similarly other Big-O complexities are:
<strong>
  <ul>
    <li>O(n!) or Factorial complexity, example: Travelling salesman problem</li>
    <li>O(n**a) or Polynomial complexity, example: Public Key Cryptography</li>
  </ul>
